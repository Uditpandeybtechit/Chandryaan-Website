                    <p id="second">The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) had undertaken two previous missions to
                        the moon,
                        namely,
                        the
                        Chandrayaan I and the Chandrayaan II. Chandrayaan-1 was launched in 2008 and lasted till 2009
                        after
                        communications to it were lost. The mission, among other things, tested a crash landing on the
                        lunar
                        surface. Chandrayaan-2, launched in 2019 attempted a soft landing on the moon but failed. The
                        third
                        mission,
                        Chandrayaan-3 took into account the drawbacks and lessons learnt from the second mission and
                        successfully
                        achieved soft landing.

                        <b>Lander payloads:</b> Chandra’s Surface Thermophysical Experiment (ChaSTE) to measure the
                        thermal
                        conductivity and temperature; Instrument for Lunar Seismic Activity (ILSA) for measuring the
                        seismicity around the landing site; Langmuir Probe (LP) to estimate the plasma density and its
                        variations. A passive Laser Retroreflector Array from NASA is accommodated for lunar laser
                        ranging
                        studies.

                        Spectroscope (LIBS) for deriving the elemental composition in the vicinity of landing site.
                        Chandrayaan-3 consists of an indigenous Lander module (LM), Propulsion module (PM) and a Rover
                        with
                        an
                        objective of developing and demonstrating new technologies required for Inter planetary
                        missions.
                        The
                        Lander will have the capability to soft land at a specified lunar site and deploy the Rover
                        which
                        will
                        carry out in-situ chemical analysis of the lunar surface during the course of its mobility. The
                        Lander
                        and the Rover have scientific payloads to carry out experiments on the lunar surface. The main
                        function
                        of PM is to carry the LM from launch vehicle injection till final lunar 100 km circular polar
                        orbit
                        and
                        separate the LM from PM. Apart from this, the Propulsion Module also has one scientific payload
                        as a
                        value addition which will be operated post separation of Lander Module. The launcher identified
                        for
                        Chandrayaan-3 is LVM3 M4 which will place the integrated module in an Elliptic Parking Orbit
                        (EPO)
                        of
                        size ~170 x 36500 km.

        <h3>Vikram Lander</h3>
        <p>The Vikram lander is responsible for the soft landing on the Moon. It is also box-shaped, with four landing
            legs and four landing thrusters capable of producing 800 newtons of thrust each. It carries the rover and
            various scientific instruments to perform on-site analysis. The lander has four variable-thrust
            engines with slew rate changing capabilities, unlike Chandrayaan-2's lander, which had five, with the fifth
            one being centrally mounted and capable only of fixed thrust. One of the main reasons for Chandrayaan-2's
            landing failure was attitude increase during the camera coasting phase. This was removed by allowing the
            lander to control attitude and thrust during all phases of descent. Attitude correction rate is increased
            from Chandrayaan-2's 10°/s to 25°/s with Chandrayaan-3. Additionally, the Chandrayaan-3 lander is equipped
            with a laser Doppler velocimeter (LDV) to allow measuring attitude in three directions.[24][25] The impact
            legs have been made stronger compared to Chandrayaan-2 and instrumentation redundancy has been improved. It
            will target a more precise 16 km2 (6.2 sq mi) landing region based on images previously provided by the
            Orbiter High-Resolution Camera onboard Chandrayaan-2's orbiter. ISRO improved the structural
            rigidity, increased polling in instruments, increased data frequency and transmission, and added additional
            multiple contingency systems to improve lander survivability in the event of failure during descent and
            landing</p>

        <h3>Rover</h3>
        <p>The Pragyan rover is a six-wheeled vehicle with a mass of 26 kilograms (57 pounds). It is 917 millimetres
            (3.009 ft) x 750 millimetres (2.46 ft) x 397 millimetres (1.302 ft) in size.[27] The rover is expected to
            take multiple measurements to support research into the composition of the lunar surface, the presence of
            water ice in the lunar soil, the history of lunar impacts, and the evolution of the Moon's atmosphere.</p>
